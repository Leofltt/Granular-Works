# Granular-Works
A repository to group all my works in the field of Granular Synthesis

Granularme! : A granular sampler I coded in March 2017. It's capable of pitch shifting, reverse playback and even simple sample playback! It's pretty rough, there're still some bugs, but it's very functional and inspirational to play. Have fun with it.
