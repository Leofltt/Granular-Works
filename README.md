# Granular-Works
A repository to group all my works in the field of Granular Synthesis

Granularme! : A granular sampler I coded in March 2017. It's capable of pitch shifting, reverse playback and even simple sample playback! It's pretty rough, there're still some bugs, but it's very functional and inspirational to play. Have fun with it.

RealTimeGrain : A maxforlive device that uses csound to granulate the audio input in realtime with controls over granulation parameters, based on the granular delay found in "Csound: A Sound and Music Computing System"
